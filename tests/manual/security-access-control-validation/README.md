## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Basic Security Tests
```powershell
# PowerShell (Windows)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests/manual/security-access-control-validation/basic-security-test.ps1

# Node.js (Cross-platform)
node tests/manual/security-access-control-validation/manual-security-validation.js
```

### Run Comprehensive Security Suite
```bash
# Run all security tests
node tests/manual/security-access-control-validation/run-security-tests.js

# Run penetration tests
node tests/manual/security-access-control-validation/penetration-tests.js
```

## 🔒 Security Requirements Tested

### 6.1 File Upload Validation
- ✅ Client-side file type and size validation
- ⚠️ Server-side authentication enforcement (issue detected)
- ✅ File type restriction (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)
- ✅ File size limits (2MB maximum)

### 6.2 User Ownership Verification
- ✅ Profile data access control
- ✅ Journal entry ownership validation
- ✅ File access restrictions
- ✅ Cross-user data isolation

### 6.3 Rate Limiting
- ✅ Upload endpoint rate limiting (5 per 15 minutes)
- ✅ Rate limiting infrastructure configured
- ⚠️ Authenticated request rate limiting needs validation

### 6.4 RLS Policy Enforcement
- ✅ Database queries scoped to authenticated user
- ✅ Automatic user ID filtering
- ✅ Data isolation between users

### 6.5 Input Sanitization (XSS Prevention)
- ✅ Client-side input sanitization (DOMPurify)
- ✅ Server-side input validation (Zod schemas)
- ✅ XSS payload rejection
- ✅ HTML content sanitization

### 6.6 Error Information Leakage Prevention
- ✅ Generic error messages
- ✅ No sensitive information in responses
- ✅ Stack trace hiding
- ⚠️ 404 handling needs improvement

### 6.7 Authentication Token Validation
- ✅ JWT signature verification
- ✅ Token format validation
- ✅ Bearer token requirement
- ✅ Token expiration enforcement

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Upload Endpoint Authentication Bypass
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION  
**Description:** Upload endpoint accessible without authentication  
**Fix:** Ensure `isAuthenticatedSupabase` middleware is properly applied  

### Issue 2: Improper 404 Handling
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Status:** REQUIRES ATTENTION  
**Description:** Non-existent endpoints return 200 instead of 404  
**Fix:** Implement proper catch-all route for undefined endpoints  

## 📊 Test Results Summary

- **Total Security Requirements:** 7
- **Fully Implemented:** 5 (71%)
- **Partially Implemented:** 2 (29%)
- **Critical Issues:** 2
- **Overall Security Score:** 71%

## 🛠️ How to Use These Tests

### For Developers
1. Run basic security tests before committing code
2. Use the security checklist for manual validation
3. Review the validation report for security status

### For Security Teams
1. Run comprehensive penetration tests
2. Review the detailed security validation report
3. Use findings to prioritize security improvements

### For QA Teams
1. Include security tests in testing workflows
2. Validate security requirements using the checklist
3. Report security issues using the provided templates

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ installed
- PowerShell (for Windows scripts)
- Development server running (`pnpm dev`)
- Environment variables configured

## 📋 Manual Testing Required

Some security aspects require manual testing:
1. **File Upload Testing** - Test with actual files of various types and sizes
2. **Cross-User Testing** - Create multiple user accounts and test data isolation
3. **Browser Security** - Test XSS prevention in actual browser environment
4. **Network Security** - Test with network monitoring tools
5. **Database Security** - Verify RLS policies directly in database

## 🔄 Continuous Security

### Regular Testing
- Run security tests with each deployment
- Include security validation in CI/CD pipeline
- Schedule periodic comprehensive security audits

### Monitoring
- Monitor for security events and anomalies
- Track authentication failures and suspicious activity
- Regular review of security logs

### Updates
- Keep security dependencies updated
- Review and update security tests regularly
- Stay informed about new security vulnerabilities

## 📞 Support

For questions about security testing or issues found:
1. Review the security checklist and validation report
2. Check the test scripts for implementation details
3. Consult the Phase 3 testing specification for requirements

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Security validation is considered successful when:
- ✅ All automated security tests pass
- ✅ No critical security vulnerabilities found
- ✅ All security requirements (6.1-6.7) fully implemented
- ✅ Manual security checklist completed
- ✅ Security validation report shows 90%+ compliance

**Current Status:** 71% - Requires attention to critical issues before production deployment.
