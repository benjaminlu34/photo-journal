Key Architectural Changes:
Type System:
Consistent use of TypeScript types across components
Proper interface definitions for data structures
Strict type checking for all operations
Better type safety for async operations
Performance Optimizations:
Added RAF for smooth animations
Proper cleanup of resources
Memoization of expensive operations
Efficient event listener management
State Management:
Type-safe store operations
Proper context value memoization
Efficient batch updates
Better rate limiting implementation
Error Handling:
Consistent error handling patterns
Proper cleanup on errors
Type-safe error boundaries
Better validation of user input
Dependencies to Note:
Requires ES2015+ support (configured in tsconfig.json)
Uses y-protocols/awareness for collaboration
Depends on DOMPurify for HTML sanitization
Uses Zod for runtime type validation
Next Steps for Pinboard Development:
Consider implementing proper error recovery mechanisms
Add comprehensive test coverage for type safety
Monitor performance of batch operations
Consider implementing proper retry mechanisms for collaboration
Add proper logging for production debugging
