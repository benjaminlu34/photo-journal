# Photo Journal - Product Vision & Purpose

## Why This Project Exists

Photo Journal was created to address the fundamental human need to capture and share life's moments in a way that mirrors how we naturally think about memories - spatially, creatively, and collaboratively. Traditional journaling apps force linear, text-heavy entries that don't reflect how memories actually form in our minds.

## Core Problems It Solves

1. **Memory Fragmentation**: Photos in one app, notes in another, voice memos elsewhere - Photo Journal unifies all memory types in one spatial canvas.

2. **Solo Journaling Isolation**: Memories are often shared experiences, but most journals are solitary. Photo Journal enables real-time collaborative memory creation.

3. **Linear Constraints**: Traditional journals force chronological, text-first entries. Photo Journal provides a spatial canvas where memories can be arranged like a physical bulletin board.

4. **Offline/Online Friction**: Most collaborative apps fail without internet. Photo Journal works offline-first with seamless sync when reconnected.

5. **Privacy vs Sharing**: Users want both private reflection and selective sharing. Photo Journal provides granular permissions per entry.

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

1. **Daily Canvas**: Each day starts with a blank spatial canvas, not a blank text page
2. **Multi-Modal Capture**: Add sticky notes containing text, images, voice, drawings, or checklists
3. **Spatial Freedom**: Drag, resize, rotate, and arrange notes like a physical bulletin board
4. **Real-Time Collaboration**: Invite friends/family to contribute to shared memories as they happen
5. **Flexible Views**: Switch between daily focus, weekly calendar, creative weekly spread, or monthly overview

### Key Interactions

- **Quick Capture**: Single click to add any content type
- **Drag & Drop**: Natural spatial arrangement with grid snapping
- **Live Cursors**: See collaborators' actions in real-time
- **Offline Mode**: Full functionality without internet, auto-sync when reconnected
- **Permission Control**: Share entries with view-only or edit permissions

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Goals
- **Effortless**: Adding memories should be as easy as placing a sticky note
- **Expressive**: Support multiple content types to capture memories fully
- **Collaborative**: Enable shared memory creation without conflicts
- **Private**: Maintain user control over what's shared and with whom
- **Reliable**: Work seamlessly offline and online

### Emotional Goals
- **Nostalgic**: Glassmorphism UI evokes physical scrapbooks and bulletin boards
- **Creative**: Spatial freedom encourages artistic expression
- **Connected**: Real-time collaboration strengthens relationships
- **Secure**: Users feel safe storing personal memories

## Target Users

1. **Families**: Creating shared memory books of vacations, milestones, daily life
2. **Friends**: Documenting trips, events, and shared experiences
3. **Individuals**: Personal reflection with creative freedom
4. **Creative Teams**: Visual project documentation and brainstorming

## Success Metrics

- Sub-100ms local operation latency
- Zero data loss from conflicts
- 90%+ offline functionality
